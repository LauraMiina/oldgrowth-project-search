"Bear Country Project (Klamath National Forest, CA)","Roughly 2,000 acres of commercial logging within Eddy Gulch Late Successional Reserve. The project would also permanently remove 923 acres of northern spotted owl (NSO) habitat in some of the only unburned forest stands in the region, home to one of the only reproductive pairs in the entire Klamath National Forest.","The project has been approved by the Klamath National Forest and due to the efforts of numerous conservation partners is currently being reviewed By Deputy Chief Christopher French under the National Old-Growth Amendment. The outcome of that review and the potential for moving this project forward is currently unknown, but community involvement, public input and advocacy efforts are still needed. If the review fails to protect these forests, the threat of logging is imminent. Luke Ruediger, Klamath Forest Alliance (siskiyoucrest@gmail.com)",,2000.00,-120.4863474,38.98644004,:,,,,
"South Fork Project (Klamath National Forest, CA)","The project proposes logging 2,455 acres, including mature and old-growth trees. It’s directly upstream from the Klamath National Forest's Bear Country Project, which also targets old forest with industrial logging. The cumulative harm to the ecosystem from these projects would be severe. The South Fork Project area is extremely remote, highly biodiverse and functions as an important wildlife connectivity corridor for old forest-dependent animals living between the Trinity Alps and Russian wilderness areas.

"Dead Laundry Project (Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest, ID)","The project proposes logging 3,838 acres of trees with commercial “regeneration harvest,” meaning clearcuts and variations of clearcuts,  many greater than 40 acres, or larger than 40 football fields.  Logging will include cutting trees more than 20 inches in diameter and cutting mature trees in designated old-growth stands.  Much of the mature forest logging will occur in unfragmented roadless areas. The Forest Service plans to build or “reconstruct” more than 200 miles of roads in this remote area, including bulldozing logging roads through old growth stands.","The Forest Service rescinded and then reissued its draft decision where it made some changes, but still proposes effectively clearcut 2,057 acres, including 14 openings that exceed 40 acres in size (44-432 acres).

"Spruce Vegetation Project (Black Hills National Forest, SD)","The project will remove virtually all spruce trees — targeting the largest and oldest spruce — across 25,000 acres, or nearly 40 square miles. Such extensive logging, including clearcuts more than 40 football fields or larger in size, will likely require miles of new roads.

This litigation success saved over 200 acres of mature and old-growth forests. Unfortunately, recently the BLM has completed a new draft Biological Assessment that forms the basis for a yet another BIological Opinion by the USFWS. These documents put the forests in the Poor Windy Timber Sale back on the chopping block. The BLM has already auctioned off and logged timber sales in the project area. In spring 2024, tree sitters occupied some of the biggest and oldest trees found within the road prisms of the project.

Upper Cheat River Project (Monongahela National Forest WV),"The project will clearcut 3,463 acres of mature hardwood forest and cost taxpayers $1.4 million. Two-thirds of the targeted stands are more than 100 years old, with some trees older than 200 years. Widespread logging at the start of the 20th century stripped hillsides of much of  the original old-growth forest but small pockets remain.","The Forest Service has identified 53 stands more than 150 years old within the project boundary. Some of those stands are proposed to be clearcut. This past winter volunteers found the 3rd largest Eastern Hemlock and the 4th largest Sugar Maple on record in West Virginia in the project area. These ancient trees are an indicator of just how old parts of this forest are. While the champion maple and oak are outside proposed clearcuts, the hemlock is in the middle of a proposed clearcut of a 60% slope with many trees over 150 years old. This winter, volunteers surveyed 3 of the 120 stands proposed for clearcut and measured 293 trees that are greater than 8 feet circumference with the largest being 17 feet around. There has been a Record of Decision  (ROD) on the project that was formally objected to in 2022 by local and environmental groups.
